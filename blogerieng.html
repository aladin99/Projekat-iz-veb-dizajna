                      It was the turn of the men's, but no less interesting part of the report on the summer street style. But while members of the fairer sex could get a lot of inspiration for various combinations of young bloggers, the opportunity for our young men to start dressing as male fashion lovers from various cities around the world is really small.<br> No, anything is possible. We present several men's fashion combinations, some of which will certainly be unacceptable for our mentality.</p>

                    <p class="text">It’s winter, so men (most often) don’t care what they walk around in until they freeze.<br> Then some fashion disasters start happening to them, which they would still be better off avoiding.<br>

                      Style for men during the winter brings a lot of interesting ideas and ways to build your personal stamp. And this is best achieved in detail.<br>
                      
                      No matter how small, the details on the sleeve or inside of the collar of the shirt, the mark on the shoe, the stripe on the Bermuda shorts, the pattern of the handkerchief in the pocket or something else, will be something you will surely always notice. <br>The clothes give a refined note and the impression of something that not everyone wears.</p>

                    <p class="text">A stylized man is also an attractive man. Just as no woman was born with infinitely thick and long eyelashes, and yet there are many very beautiful ones in the city, so it is with men - it's time to get acquainted with the rules of caring for your masculinity.<br>

                      Dear men, you are young and strict rules do not apply to you. The most important thing to emphasize though is that you need to be properly trained wherever you go. A tracksuit is not clothing for college or a job interview.<br>
                      
                      Experiment with clothes, now is the right time to look for your style. You are allowed to have a completely new style every season. Often most clothes will be casual and tailored for all occasions.<br></p>

                    <p class="text">The following are simple rules that will make it easier for you to dress ceremoniously and save you from the worst mistakes.<br>

                      
                      - Not that flashy tie.<br>
                      
                      – Keep in mind what the audience will be like. The team at your conservative uncle’s second wedding will be different from the one at the wedding of someone who recently graduated from an art academy.<br>
                      
                      – The tailcoat has to do with gloves and tails. A tuxedo requires a bow tie. Formally it can mean anything - so ask.<br>
                      
                      – Today, two tuxedo rentals cost as much as buying one.<br>
                      
                      – A factory-tied bow tie is not a bad thing.<br><br>

                    <p class="text">The rules, in fact the advice of Tom Ford, should be the basis that every man should respect, if he wants to be respected as well. A modern man, in Ford's opinion, behaves like this:<br>

                      1. "You should always give your best in the world, because that's how you give respect to the people around you."<br>
                      
                      2. “A gentleman has to work. People who don’t work are usually very boring, but they are also bored. You have to be passionate, you have to get involved and you have to contribute to this world. ”<br>
                      
                      3. "Manners are very important and you need to know when some things are appropriate. I always open the door to women, wear their coat, make sure they walk on the inside of the sidewalk. Get up when people arrive and leave the table. ”<br>
                      
                      4. "Don't be conceited or racist or judge people by their past."
                      <br>
                      
                      5. A man should never wear shorts in the city. Bermuda shorts and shorts are always inappropriate. Shorts should only be worn in training or on the beach. ”<br>
                    </p>

                    <p class="text">It is important to know that you choose the right clothes for your figure, but an even more important rule is that the clothes should be the right size, which men often miss.<br> Even the most expensive shirt, pants or suit will look ridiculous if it is too big or too short.<br>

                      Still, we have a summer ahead of us that dictates a relaxed and very modern style. In the gallery you will see combinations that we want to expand your horizons - you will probably like the most what is similar to your style…<br> Let's be a little braver, then steal the idea, get inspired and be different this summer.<br>

                <p class="text">It is true that handsome men can wear whatever they want, but the trend that the government will make all men happy! SUSPENDERS! <br>
                  All men can wear suspenders.<br>
                  In addition to being trendy, suspenders will serve you instead of belts.<br>

                  The new collection of the JJSuspenders brand will delight you! In various colors and styles - leather suspenders, with a clip or a button, one-color or colorful, narrow or wide, suspenders with polka dots…<br>

                  You can wear them at work, on a date, on a walk… depending on whether you fit them with a shirt or a T-shirt.<br>
                  Rule # 1 Never wear suspenders and a belt at the same time. Under no circumstances. Unless of course, if you lost a bet with another.<br>

                  Rule # 2 Always choose the right suspenders with style and opportunity.<br>
                  
                  The suspenders they would wear at work, in the office, may not be ideal for a weekend walk or a night out. Design and color are very important.

        <img id="slikasavet" src="Saveti.jpg" alt="slikasavet">
        <p class="savettekst">
          If you are tired of looking at you strangely because of what you have appeared in society and asking you that you may not have passed a mirror while coming to town, we give you some useful and above all applicable tips, thanks to which you will never do again fatal mistakes when it comes to dressing.<br><br>

            So, if you don't have enough will, time or even the desire to follow current events when it comes to men's fashion, we present you with a few tricks that will show you in a beautiful light and as a person with style, regardless of the trend that reigns. Although the choice of wardrobe depends on your lifestyle, physique, character and the occasion for which you dress, you will never make a mistake if you stick to the classic attitude.<br><br>

            First of all, every man who sticks to his style (under construction) should have three things in his closet - a white shirt, jeans and a jacket. Yet if you guess the size that suits you, you’ve stabbed the winning combination. Thanks to these extremely simple clothing items, which will be easy for you to find and combine, you will look casual, relaxed, business and modern at the same time.<br><br>

            When buying clothes, try to avoid synthetics and choose cotton and linen materials, because first of all, the former seem cheap and you will sweat more in them. Remember, don't be ashamed of the size you are wearing, from a larger or smaller number, the only worse image is oversized and too tight pants, too wide or too short shirts and the like, in which you will look as if you did not manage in your own closet.<br><br>

            You will be able to combine a simple white shirt with a variety of clothing items during the year. You can wear the sleeves lowered or rolled up, during the summer you can put it unbuttoned over the T-shirt or wear it under the sweater in the winter. When you learn to deal with a white shirt, try to do the same with the one in color or with some interesting pattern. Make sure they don't differ much from the wardrobe you already have. Never buy a shirt with which you do not have the appropriate pants, shoes or coat at a given time, unless you are ready for an extra expense.<br><br>

            Although the variations as far as jackets are concerned are numerous, the ones that will never go out of fashion are definitely leather jackets. Those who are faithful to her, say that she gets better and better with the years of wearing. The most common colors in which you will find them are black and dark brown, and they suit almost all types of men. There are also summer and winter variants, so pay attention when buying, whether it is installed or not.<br><br>

            Since you have already mastered white and all other shirts, you should get acquainted with the advantages of good sweaters. They come in a variety of variations and colors. If you do not feel particularly comfortable in a jacket, you are free to wear a sweater over your shirt, and it will make you look equally business-like. Combine lighter shirts with darker sweaters to make them stand out and never overdo it with patterns. More modest is always more desirable.<br><br>

          It may be difficult for you to get used to wearing shoes at first, but sneakers and a jacket just don't work. Nobody says that you have to wear classic shoes, because today there are a thousand variations of modern youth shoes, which are even more comfortable than the sneakers you are used to.<br><br>
